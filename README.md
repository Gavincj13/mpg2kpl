# MPG to KPL Unit Conversion with Python 
A MPG to KPL converter written in python
This was the first Coding Challenge that we did, and it was pretty challenging at the beginnging when first trying to figure out how to do everything since it was all brand new to me. 
I enjoyed applying real life concepts into the work with the unit conversions, and with how the unit conversions is something that is interesting to me personally was also pretty neat. 
I learned through writing this code about the concept of doing the simplest thing that could possibly work, and how applicable that is when it comes to coding. 
This is definitely an area where I want to spend more time learning and writing code on, and how certain code could work better than others when it comes to writing unit conversions.
